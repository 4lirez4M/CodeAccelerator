What Are Python Frameworks?
Python web frameworks are a collection of modules or packages which help developers in writing a web application in the Python programming language.

When they choose Python for rapid development, they donâ€™t have to worry about the use of low-level facts, like multiple protocols, thread management, or sockets.

Frameworks automate the performance of basic solutions that provide developers the adaptability to concentrate on websites instead of the general routine processes.

The web development frameworks give website developers, web designers, system administrators, and Linux operators the freedom to develop a structure by providing a default model for app structuring that is quick, consistent, and effortlessly maintainable.
